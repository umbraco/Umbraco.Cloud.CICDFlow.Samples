# Umbraco Cloud CICD Flow Samples
Scripts and pipeline samples for the CI/CD Flow feature on Umbraco Cloud.

The Scripts are provided as is. This means that the scripts will do the bare minimum for a pipeline that is utilizing the CI/CD flow.
The idea is that they can be integrated into your own pipelines so they will have the ability to do deployments to your Umbraco Cloud projects.

You can use the same PowerShell scripts for Github and Azure Devops.
